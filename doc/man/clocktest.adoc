NAME
----
clocktest - Xenomai Clock Test

SYNOPSIS
--------
*clocktest* ['OPTIONS']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*clocktest* is part of the Xenomai test suite and tests the Clock. For each
CPU, it repeatedly prints a time offset (compared to the reference
gettimeofday()), a drift value, the number of warps and the maximum warp in
microseconds.

For this program to work, you need to run a suitable Xenomai enabled kernel
with the respective module (xeno_posix).

OPTIONS
-------
*-C <clock_id>*::
     clock to be tested, default=0 (CLOCK_REALTIME=0, CLOCK_MONOTONIC=1, 
CLOCK_HOST_REALTIME=42)

*-T <test_duration_seconds>*::
     default=0 (Never stop, ^C to end)

*-D*::
     print extra diagnostics for CLOCK_HOST_REALTIME
