<h2 id="_configuration">1. Configuration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">User programs and libraries</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
As with Xenomai 2.x, <code>xeno-config</code> is available for retrieving the
compilation and link flags for building Xenomai 3.x applications. This
script will work for both the Cobalt and Mercury environments
indifferently.
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Each <code>--skin=&lt;api&gt;</code> option specifier can be abbreviated as
 --&lt;api&gt;. For instance, <code>--psos</code> is a shorthand for <code>--skin=psos</code> on
 the command line.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Specifying <code>--[skin=]cobalt</code> or <code>--[skin=]posix</code> on the command line
  is strictly equivalent. However, this does not make sense with
  <em>Mercury</em> which does not define these switches.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>--[skin=]alchemy</code> replaces the former <code>--skin=native</code> switch.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>--core</code> can be used to retrieve the name of the Xenomai core system
  for which <code>xeno-config</code> was generated. Possible output values are
  <code>cobalt</code> and <code>mercury</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>--no-auto-init</code> can be passed to disable automatic initialization
  of the Copperplate library when the application process enters the
  <code>main()</code> routine. In such a case, the application code using any API
  based on the Copperplate layer, shall call the <code>copperplate_init()</code>
  routine manually, as part of its initialization process, <em>before</em>
  any real-time service is invoked.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<code>--enable-x86-sep</code> was renamed to <code>--enable-x86-vsyscall</code> to fix a
  misnomer. This option should be left enabled (default), unless
  <strong>linuxthreads</strong> are used instead of <strong>NPTL</strong>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<h2 id="_getting_the_system_state">2. Getting the system state</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Querying the state of the real-time system should be done via the new
Xenomai registery interface available with Xenomai 3.x, which is
turned on when <code>--enable-registry</code> is passed to the configuration
script for building the Xenomai libraries and programs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The new registry support is common to the Cobalt and Mercury cores,
with only marginal differences due to the presence (or lack of) co-
kernel in the system.</p></div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_proc_xenomai_interface_changes">2.1. /proc/xenomai interface changes</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The legacy /proc/xenomai interface is still available when running
over the Cobalt core. The following changes compared to Xenomai 2.x
took place though:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Thread status
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>All pseudo-files reporting the various thread states moved under the
new <code>sched/</code> hierarchy, i.e.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>{sched, stat, acct}</code> &#8594; <code>sched/{threads, stat, acct}</code></p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Clocks
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>With the introduction of dynamic clock registration in the Cobalt
core, the <code>clock/</code> hierarchy was added, to reflect the current state
of all timers from the registered Xenomai clocks.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is no kernel-based time base management anymore with Xenomai
2.99.0. Functionally speaking, only the former <em>master</em> time base
remains, periodic timing is now controlled locally from the Xenomai
libraries in user-space.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai 2.99.0 defines a built-in clock named <em>coreclk</em>, which has
the same properties than the former <em>master</em> time base available with
Xenomai 2.x (i.e. tickless with nanosecond resolution).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As a consequence of these changes, The information once available from
<code>timerstat/master</code> are now obtained by reading <code>clock/coreclk</code>, and
the <code>timebases</code> file was removed.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Core clock gravity
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The gravity value for a Xenomai clock gives the amount of time
expressed in clock ticks, by which the next shot should be
anticipated. This is a static adjustment value, to take into account
the basic latency of the system for responding to an external event
(hardware-wise, and software-wise). This value is commonly assessed by
measuring the typical latency of an idle system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>latency</code> pseudo-file holds this value expressed as a count of
nanoseconds.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>latency</code> now represents the sum of the scheduling <strong>and</strong> hardware
timer reprogramming latencies of the core clock. This departs from
Xenomai 2.x for which only the former was accounted for in the clock
gravity value.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>interfaces</code> was removed
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Only the POSIX and RTDM APIs remain implemented directly in kernel
space. All other APIs are implemented in user-space over the
Copperplate layer. This makes the former <code>interfaces</code> contents
basically useless, since the corresponding information for the
POSIX/RTDM interfaces can be obtained via <code>sched/threads</code>.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<code>registry/usage</code> changed format
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The new print out is %&lt;used slot count&gt;/%&lt;total slot count&gt;.</p></div>

<h3 id="_loading_xenomai_libraries_dynamically">3.1. Loading Xenomai libraries dynamically</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The new <code>--enable-dlopen-libs</code> configuration switch must be turned on
to allow Xenomai libaries to be dynamically loaded via dlopen(3).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This replaces the former <code>--enable-dlopen-skins</code> switch. Unlike the
latter, <code>--enable-dlopen-libs</code> does not implicitly disable support for
thread local storage, but rather selects a suitable TLS model
(i.e. <em>global-dynamic</em>).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_thread_local_storage">3.2. Thread local storage</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The former <code>--with-__thread</code> configuration switch was renamed
<code>--enable-tls</code>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As mentioned earlier, TLS is now available to dynamically loaded
Xenomai libraries, e.g. <code>--enable-tls --enable-dlopen-libs</code> on a
configuration line is valid. This would select the <em>global-dynamic</em>
TLS model instead of <em>initial-exec</em>, to make sure all thread-local
variables may be accessed from any code module.</p></div>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_main_thread_shadowing">4.1. Main thread shadowing</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By default, any application linking against <code>libcobalt</code> has its main
thread attached to the real-time system automatically, this process is
called <em>auto-shadowing</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This behavior may be disabled at runtime, by setting the XENO_NOSHADOW
variable in the application process environment, before the
<code>libcobalt</code> library constructors are executed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This replaces the former static mechanism available with Xenomai 2.x,
based on turning on <code>--enable-dlopen-skins</code> when configuring. Starting
with Xenomai 3.x, applications should set the XENO_NOSHADOW variable
using putenv(3), before loading <code>libcolbalt</code> using dlopen(3).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When auto-shadowing is enabled, global memory locking is also
performed, and remains in effect afterwards
(i.e. mlockall(MCL_CURRENT|MCL_FUTURE)).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_shadow_signal_handler">4.2. Shadow signal handler</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai&#8217;s <code>libcobalt</code> installs a handler for the SIGWINCH (aka
<em>SIGSHADOW</em>) signal. This signal may be sent by the Cobalt core to any
real-time application, for handling internal duties.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Applications are allowed to interpose on the SIGSHADOW handler,
provided they first forward all signal notifications to this routine,
then eventually handle all events the Xenomai handler won&#8217;t process.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This handler was renamed from <code>xeno_sigwinch_handler()</code> (Xenomai 2.x)
to <code>cobalt_sigshadow_handler()</code> in Xenomai 3.x. The function prototype
did not change though, i.e.:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>int cobalt_sigshadow_handler(int sig, siginfo_t *si, void *ctxt)</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A non-zero value is returned whenever the event was handled internally
by the Xenomai system.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_debug_signal_handler">4.3. Debug signal handler</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai&#8217;s <code>libcobalt</code> installs a handler for the SIGXCPU (aka
<em>SIGDEBUG</em>) signal. This signal may be sent by the Cobalt core to any
real-time application, for notifying various debug events.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Applications are allowed to interpose on the SIGDEBUG handler,
provided they eventually forward all signal notifications they won&#8217;t
process to the Xenomai handler.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This handler was renamed from <code>xeno_handle_mlock_alert()</code> (Xenomai
2.x) to <code>cobalt_sigdebug_handler()</code> in Xenomai 3.x. The function
prototype did not change though, i.e.:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>void cobalt_sigdebug_handler(int sig, siginfo_t *si, void *ctxt)</code></p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_copperplate_auto_initialization">4.4. Copperplate auto-initialization</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Copperplate is a library layer which mediates between the real-time
core services available on the platform, and the API exposed to the
application. It provides typical programming abstractions for
emulating real-time APIs. All non-POSIX APIs are based on Copperplate
services (e.g. <em>alchemy</em>, <em>psos</em>, <em>vxworks</em>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When Copperplate is built for running over the Cobalt core, it sits on
top of the <code>libcobalt</code> library. Conversely, it is directly stacked on
top of the <strong>glibc</strong> when built for running over the Mercury core.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Normally, Copperplate should initialize from a call issued by the
<code>main()</code> application routine. To make this process transparent for the
user, the <code>xeno-config</code> script emits link flags which temporarily
overrides the <code>main()</code> routine with a Copperplate-based replacement,
running the proper initialization code as required, before branching
back to the user-defined application entry point.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This behavior may be disabled by passing the <code>--no-auto-init</code> option
(see the next section).</p></div>

<h2 id="_posix_interface_changes">6. POSIX interface changes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>As mentioned earlier, the former <strong>POSIX skin</strong> is known as the <strong>Cobalt
API</strong> in Xenomai 3.x, available as <code>libcobalt.{so,a}</code>. The Cobalt API
also includes the code of the former <code>libxenomai</code>, which is no more a
standalone library.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><code>libcobalt</code> exposes the set of POSIX and ISO/C standard features
specifically implemented by Xenomai to honor real-time requirements
using the Cobalt core.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Interrupt management</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
The former <code>pthread_intr</code> API once provided by Xenomai 2.x is gone.
</p>
<div class="paragraph" id="irqhandling"><p>Rationale: handling real-time interrupt events from user-space can
be done safely only if some top-half code exists for acknowledging
the issuing device request from kernel space. This should be done
via a RTDM driver, exposing a <code>read(2)</code> or <code>ioctl(2)</code> interface, for
waiting for interrupt events from applications running in
user-space.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Failing this, the low-level interrupt service code in user-space
would be sensitive to external thread management actions, such as
being stopped because of GDB/ptrace(2) interaction. Unfortunately,
preventing the device acknowledge code from running upon interrupt
request may cause unfixable breakage to happen (e.g. IRQ storm
typically).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since the application should provide proper top-half code in a
dedicated RTDM driver for synchronizing on IRQ receipt, the RTDM API
available in user-space is sufficient.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Removing the <code>pthread_intr</code> API should be considered as a
strong hint for keeping the top-half interrupt handling code in
kernel space.</p></div>
<div class="admonitionblock" id="userirqtip">
<table><tr>
<td class="icon">

</td>
<td class="content">For receiving interrupt notifications within your application, you
should create a small RTDM driver handling the corresponding IRQ
(see <code>rtdm_irq_request()</code>). The IRQ handler should wake a thread up
in your application by posting some event (see <code>rtdm_sem_up()</code>,
<code>rtdm_sem_timeddown()</code>). The application should sleep on this event
by calling into the RTDM driver, either via a <code>read(2)</code> or
<code>ioctl(2)</code> request, handled by a dedicated operation handler (see
<code>rtdm_dev_register()</code>).</td>

</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Scheduling</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
Calling <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> may cause a secondary mode switch
  for the caller, but does not cause any mode switch for the target
  thread unlike with Xenomai 2.x.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a requirement for maintaining both the <strong>glibc</strong> and the
Xenomai scheduler in sync, with respect to thread priorities, since
the former maintains a process-local priority cache for the threads
it knows about. Therefore, an explicit call to the the regular
<code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> shall be issued upon each priority change
Xenomai-wise, for maintaining consistency.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the Xenomai 2.x implementation, the thread being set a new
priority would receive a SIGSHADOW signal, eventually handled as a
request to call <strong>glibc</strong>'s <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> immediately.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Rationale: the target Xenomai thread may hold a mutex or any
resource which may only be held in primary mode, in which case
switching to secondary mode for applying the priority change at
any random location over a signal handler may create a pathological
issue. In addition, <strong>glibc</strong>'s <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> is not
async-safe, which makes the former method fragile.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Conversely, a thread which calls <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> does know
unambiguously whether the current calling context is safe for the
incurred migration.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A new SCHED_WEAK class is available to POSIX threads, which may be
  optionally turned on using the <code>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_WEAK</code> kernel
  configuration switch.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>By this feature, Xenomai now accepts Linux real-time scheduling
policies (SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR) to be weakly scheduled by the Cobalt
core, within a low priority scheduling class (i.e. below the Xenomai
real-time classes, but still above the idle class).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Xenomai 2.x already had a limited form of such policy, based on
scheduling SCHED_OTHER threads at the special SCHED_FIFO,0 priority
level in the Xenomai core. SCHED_WEAK is a generalization of such
policy, which provides for 99 priority levels, to cope with the full
extent of the regular Linux SCHED_FIFO/RR priority range.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For instance, a (non real-time) Xenomai thread within the SCHED_WEAK
class at priority level 20 in the Cobalt core, may be scheduled with
policy SCHED_FIFO/RR at priority 20, by the Linux kernel. The code
fragment below would set the scheduling parameters accordingly,
assuming the Cobalt version of <code>pthread_setschedparam()</code> is invoked:</p></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>        struct sched_param param = {
               .sched_priority = -20,
        };

        pthread_setschedparam(tid, SCHED_FIFO, &amp;param);</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Switching a thread to the SCHED_WEAK class can be done by negating
the priority level in the scheduling parameters sent to the Cobalt
core. For instance, SCHED_FIFO, prio=-7 would be scheduled as
SCHED_WEAK, prio=7 by the Cobalt core.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>SCHED_OTHER for a Xenomai-enabled thread is scheduled as
SCHED_WEAK,0 by the Cobalt core. When the SCHED_WEAK support is
disabled in the kernel configuration, only SCHED_OTHER is available
for weak scheduling of threads by the Cobalt core.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
A new SCHED_QUOTA class is available to POSIX threads, which may be
  optionally turned on using the <code>CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA</code> kernel
  configuration switch.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This policy enforces a limitation on the CPU consumption of
threads over a globally defined period, known as the quota
interval. This is done by pooling threads with common requirements
in groups, and giving each group a share of the global period (see
CONFIG_XENO_OPT_SCHED_QUOTA_PERIOD).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When threads have entirely consumed the quota allotted to the group
they belong to, the latter is suspended as a whole, until the next
quota interval starts. At this point, a new runtime budget is given
to each group, in accordance with its share.</p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
When called from primary mode, sched_yield() now relinquishes the
  CPU in case no context switch happened as a result of the manual
  round-robin.
</p>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Typically, a Xenomai thread undergoing the SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR
policy with no contender at the same priority level would still be
delayed for a while. This delay ends next time the regular Linux
kernel switches tasks, or a kernel (virtual) tick has elapsed
(TICK_NSEC), whichever comes first.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Rationale: it is most probably unwanted that sched_yield() does not
cause any context switch, since this service is commonly used for
implementing a poor man&#8217;s cooperative scheduling. A typical use case
involves a Xenomai thread running in primary mode which needs to
yield the CPU to another thread running in secondary mode. By
waiting for a context switch to happen in the regular kernel, we
guarantee that the CPU has been relinquished for a while. By
limiting this delay, we prevent a regular high priority SCHED_FIFO
thread stuck in a tight loop, from locking out the delayed Xenomai
thread indefinitely.</p></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">Thread management</div><ul>

<p>
The default POSIX thread stack size was raised to
  <code>PTHREAD_STACK_MIN * 4</code>. The minimum stack size enforced by the
  <code>libcobalt</code> library is <code>PTHREAD_STACK_MIN + getpagesize()</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
pthread_set_mode_np() now accepts PTHREAD_DISABLE_LOCKBREAK, which
disallows breaking the scheduler lock. When unset (default case), a
thread which holds the scheduler lock drops it temporarily while
sleeping.

<div class="paragraph"><p>Cobalt-based signals are stricly real-time. Both the sender and

system call for non thread-directed signals (i.e. pid &#8656; 0). In this
case, the caller switches to secondary mode.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Otherwise, Cobalt first attempts to deliver a thread-directed signal
to the thread whose kernel TID matches the given process id. If this
thread is not waiting for signals at the time of the call, kill() then
attempts to deliver the signal to a thread from the same process,
which currently waits for a signal.</p></div>
