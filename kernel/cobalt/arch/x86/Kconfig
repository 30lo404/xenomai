	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal
	instruction stream. It can handle the types of high-precision
	floating-point processing operations commonly found in
	scientific, engineering, and business applications.
	If your target system has no FPU, say NO here; otherwise,
	enabling FPU support when available may greatly improve
	performance. You can obtain more information about the
	Float-Point Unit on the x86 platform at the following URL:
