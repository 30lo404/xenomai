config XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC
	depends on XENO_SKIN_RTDM
	tristate "RTIPC protocol family"
	help

	This driver provides the real-time IPC protocol family
	(PF_RTIPC) over RTDM.

config XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC_XDDP
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC
	select XENO_OPT_PIPE
	bool "XDDP cross-domain datagram protocol"
	help

	Xenomai's XDDP protocol enables threads to exchange datagrams
	across the Xenomai/Linux domain boundary, using "message
	pipes".

	Message pipes are bi-directional FIFO communication channels
	allowing data exchange between real-time Xenomai threads and
	regular (i.e. non real-time) user-space processes. Message
	pipes are datagram-based and thus natively preserve message
	boundaries, but they can also be used in byte stream mode when
	sending from the real-time to the non real-time domain.

	The maximum number of communication ports available in the
	system can be configured using the XENO_OPT_PIPE_NRDEV option
	from the Nucleus menu.

	NOTE: this protocol is a replacement for the legacy RT_PIPE
	interface still available from the native skin, but which is
	scheduled for removal in Xenomai 3.

config XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC_IDDP
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC
	bool "IDDP intra-domain datagram protocol"
	help

	Xenomai's IDDP protocol enables real-time threads to exchange
	datagrams within the Xenomai domain.

config XENO_OPT_IDDP_NRPORT
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_RTIPC_IDDP
	int "Number of communication ports"
	default 32
	help

	This parameter defines the number of IDDP ports available in
	the system for creating receiver endpoints. Port numbers range
	from 0 to CONFIG_XENO_OPT_IDDP_NRPORT - 1.
